Village lets you run commands on your own devices through a lightweight portal: a sender posts a route, a listener executes it, and the portal relays the output back. The Cloud Functions only authenticate and route; every device owns its own execution and validation.

This site is your quick reference for setup, CLI usage, and how the system hangs together (Firebase RTDB + Cloud Functions, permanent device IDs, fast polling listeners). Use it to onboard new machines fast and remind yourself how routing, auth, and statuses work when debugging in the field.
