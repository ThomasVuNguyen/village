Why am I building this?

The internet was invented to allow people to share information and resources across vast distances.

With that we have shared information between each other at an unprecedented scale.

However, sharing computational resources interests me greatly.

If you want to use a large amount of computational resources, you call an API or use a cloud service.

If you have computational resources that you want to share, you build an API and deploy to a cloud service.

These 2 steps are expensive and time-consuming. 

I believe this process should feel free and seamless. You should be able to say:

- Hey Alan next door, I want to use your computer's power
- And you Bob, you can borrow my GPU's power

or even better: 
- Hi world, I have needs for computational resources - anyone willing to give it to me?

Village was built on this idea.
